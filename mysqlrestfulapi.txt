Node express is used to create a node server. 
This is a CRUD application created using restful api 
developed using javascript for mysql database backend.

demo is the mysql database holding the tasks table.
tasks -> id, title, status (taskid, task, and task_status [pending or done])

The api can be tested using POSTMAN:

GET request on http://localhost:3000/tasks 
Gives a list of tasks

POST request on http://localhost:3000/tasks 
with json file with fields title and status filled with some data
creates a task. Id gets automatically added.

PUT request on http://localhost:3000/tasks/id 
with json file with fields title and status filled with some data
updates a task with the given Id.

Finally, 
DELETE request on http://localhost:3000/tasks/id 
deletes a task with the given id.
